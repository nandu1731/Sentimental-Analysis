# Sentimental-Analysis

Sentimental Analysis, is an approach to natural language processing (NLP) that identifies the emotional tone behind a body of text.This is a popular way for organizations to determine and categorize opinions about a product, service, or idea.

# Bi-directional Long short term memory

With the regular LSTM, we can make input flow in one direction, either backwards or forward. However, in bi-directional, we can make the input flow in both directions to preserve the future and the past information.

# Example

I love Apple.Beacuse it's sweet.
I love Apple. Beacuse their product quality was good.

By observing these two sentences, we can't say whether the apple is fruit or company name.
But if we observe the sentence from backwards, we can easily say to which category it belongs.That's why we use Bi-LSTM Model.
